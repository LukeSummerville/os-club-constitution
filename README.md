# os-club-constitution

This repository contains the constitution for a future open source club at UC San Diego.

The constitution itself is found at `CONSTITUTION.md`.

Check out the Issues and Pull requests tabs to see what's the current status of this constitution.

## Releases

Each change to the constition is given a verion number on GitHub as a [release](https://github.com/asg017/os-club-constitution/releases). As of now, before we get official approval from the school, this are our goals:

|Version tag|Completed when:
|-|-
|`v1.0-alpha`|All of our initial TODO items are complete
|`v1.0-beta`|We send in our first, proofread/edited draft of the constitution to the student org office
|`v1.0`|The student org office approves our constitution!

After we have `v1.0` complete, future constitutional changes are up to the board of the new club. I'm guessing any minor changes to the constitution will increment the 2nd number in the verion name (e.g. `v1.1`, `v1.2`, `v.1.12` etc.), and major changes that need to be approved by the student office will increment the 1st number (e.g. `v2.0`, `v3.0`, `v14.0`, etc).
